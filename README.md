# github-contributions-api


Setup an API hosted via vercel ðŸ”¥ [`API Invocation`](https://github-contributions-api-plum.vercel.app/awindest/2023).

## Setup a 'hobby' account on vercel
## Connected to my github account
## Created a project
## Now everytime I push to the repository it automatically get deployed into production.

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "pertinent message"
git push
```

## BOOM! ðŸ’¥ auto deploy into production. Sweet!

Once you've created a project and installed dependencies with `npm install` (or `pnpm install` or `yarn`), start a development server:

```bash
npm run dev

# or start the server and open the app in a new browser tab
npm run dev -- --open
```

## Building

To create a production version of your app:

```bash
npm run build
```

You can preview the production build with `npm run preview`.

> To deploy your app, you may need to install an [adapter](https://kit.svelte.dev/docs/adapters) for your target environment.
This was not necessary as sveltekit has the adapter-auto which seamlessly works with vercel behind the scenes.
